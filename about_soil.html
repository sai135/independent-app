    <h3>About Soil</h3>
    <hr>
<p>The pedosphere interfaces with the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere.[1] The term pedolith
, used commonly to refer to the soil, translates to ground stone in the sense fundamental stone, from the ancient Greek
πέδον 'ground, earth'. Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a
porous phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution).[2][3] Accordingly, soil scientists can
envisage soils as a three-state system of solids, liquids, and gases.[4]</p>
<p>Soil is a product of several factors: the influence of climate, relief (elevation, orientation, and slope of terrain),
organisms, and the soil's parent materials (original minerals) interacting over time.[5] It continually undergoes 
development by way of numerous physical, chemical and biological processes, which include weathering with associated 
erosion. Given its complexity and strong internal connectedness, soil ecologists regard soil as an ecosystem.[6]</p>
<p>Most soils have a dry bulk density (density of soil taking into account voids when dry) between 1.1 and 1.6 g/cm3, 
while the soil particle density is much higher, in the range of 2.6 to 2.7 g/cm3.[7] Little of the soil of planet Earth is
older than the Pleistocene and none is older than the Cenozoic,[8] although fossilized soils are preserved from as far back
as the Archean.</p>
<p>soil science has two basic branches of study: edaphology and pedology. Edaphology studies the influence of soils on 
living things.[10] Pedology focuses on the formation, description (morphology), and classification of soils in their 
natural environment.[11] In engineering terms, soil is included in the broader concept of regolith, which also includes
other loose material that lies above the bedrock, as can be found on the Moon and on other celestial objects.[12]</p>
