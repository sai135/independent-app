  <h3>Plant's evolution</h3>
  <hr>
<p>The evolution of plants has resulted in increasing levels of complexity, from the earliest algal mats, through 
bryophytes, lycopods, ferns to the complex gymnosperms and angiosperms of today. Plants in all of these groups continue to 
thrive, especially in the environments in which they evolved.</p>
<p>An algal scum formed on the land 1,200 million years ago, but it was not until the Ordovician Period, around 450 million
years ago, that land plants appeared.[41] However, new evidence from the study of carbon isotope ratios in Precambrian 
rocks has suggested that complex photosynthetic plants developed on the earth over 1000 m.y.a.[42] For more than a century
it has been assumed that the ancestors of land plants evolved in aquatic environments and then adapted to a life on land,an
idea usually credited to botanist Frederick Orpen Bower in his 1908 book The Origin of a Land Flora. A recent alternative 
view, supported by genetic evidence, is that they evolved from terrestrial single-celled algae,[43] and that even the 
common ancestor of red and green algae, and the unicellular freshwater algae glaucophytes, originated in a terrestrial 
environment in freshwater biofilms or microbial mats.[44] Primitive land plants began to diversify in the late Silurian 
Period, around 420 million years ago, and the results of their diversification are displayed in remarkable detail in an 
early Devonian fossil assemblage from the Rhynie chert. This chert preserved early plants in cellular detail, petrified in
 volcanic springs. By the middle of the Devonian Period most of the features recognised in plants today are present, 
 including roots, leaves and secondary wood, and by late Devonian times seeds had evolved.[45] Late Devonian plants had 
 thereby reached a degree of sophistication that allowed them to form forests of tall trees. Evolutionary innovation 
 continued in the Carboniferous and later geological periods and is ongoing today. Most plant groups were relatively 
 unscathed by the Permo-Triassic extinction event, although the structures of communities changed. This may have set the 
 scene for the evolution of flowering plants in the Triassic (~200 million years ago), which exploded in the Cretaceous 
 and Tertiary. The latest major group of plants to evolve were the grasses, which became important in the mid Tertiary, 
 from around 40 million years ago. The grasses, as well as many other groups, evolved new mechanisms of metabolism to 
 survive the low CO2 and warm, dry conditions of the tropics over the last 10 million years.</p>
